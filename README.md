Monte Carlo Simulation of an investment portfolio

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
When we invest a certain amount of money every month, at a given rate of return, and take a traditional savings calculation approach, we can find out the total amount we save, and interest gained at the end of say, 30 years. However, this assumes there is no uncertainty in the amount that increases every month. Hence, identifying a few random variable factors, we can calculate a probable total amount saved using monte carlo simulations.

### Hypothesis before running the simulation:
The total savings at the end of the said period is more than the savings calculated traditionally.
Simulation's variables of uncertainty
### Simulation's variables of uncertainty
The rate of return each year and the market volatility.

## Instructions on how to use the program:
None
